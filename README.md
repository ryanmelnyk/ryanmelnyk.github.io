I study plant-bacteria interactions from the perspective of bacterial evolution. This means working with large isolate collections, comparative genomics, and experimental genetics to develop a deeper understanding of how bacteria compete, survive and evolve on the plant root (the "rhizosphere"). Ultimately, I want to  use this knowledge to develop microbial solutions to improve the productivity and sustainability of 21st century agriculture.

Since 2017, I've been funded by the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/) through the [Life Sciences Research Foundation](http://www.lsrf.org/) to study rhizosphere bacteria. Working with [Dr. Cara Haney](http://haneylab.msl.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, I used the highly tractable *Pseudomonas*-*Arabidopsis* model system to understand how variation in gene content can affect plant health and bacterial fitness on the plant root. In the Haney Lab, I developed [PyParanoid](https://github.com/ryanmelnyk/PyParanoid) which is a python package for identifying homologous genes across thousands of bacterial genomes. Using PyParanoid, I found that genomic island gain and loss in a clade of root-associated *Pseudomonas* spp. can trigger shifts in lifestyle from beneficial to pathogenic.

In May 2018, I began working in the [Sundar Lab](http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/Labs/sundar/index.html) at UC Davis to begin working on a commercially relevant system: the microbiome of the rice rhizosphere. UC Davis is located in the Sacramento Valley, which is home to the majority of California's billion dollar-per-year rice production industry. By studying bacteria isolated from rice fields throughout the Sacramento Valley, I am exploring how agriculture can affect the population structure, evolution, and function of rhizosphere bacteria.
