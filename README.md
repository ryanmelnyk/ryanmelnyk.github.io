I study plant-bacteria interactions from the perspective of bacterial pangenome evolution. This means working with large isolate collections, comparative genomics, and experimental genetics to develop a deeper understanding of how bacteria compete, survive and evolve on the plant root. Ultimately, I want to  
use this knowledge to develop microbial solutions to improve the productivity and sustainability of 21st century agriculture.

Currently I'm a postdoc with [Dr. Cara Haney](http://haneylab.msl.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. I use the highly tractable **Pseudomonas**-**Arabidopsis** model system to understand how variation in gene content can affect . Recently, I've developed [PyParanoid](https://github.com/ryanmelnyk/PyParanoid) which is a python package for identifying homologous genes across really large sets (i.e. 1000s) of bacterial genomes. Using PyParanoid, I've found that genomic island gain and loss in a clade of root-associated **Pseudomonas** spp. can trigger shifts in lifestyle from beneficial to pathogenic.
